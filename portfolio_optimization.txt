Portfolio Optimization
- Given a set of assets and timeperiod, find an allocation of funds to assets that maximizes its performance

Performance
- We could choose from number of matrices, including cumulative returm, volatility or risk, and risk adjusted return which is sharpe ratio

Example Portfolio

.25  GOOG
.25  AAPL
.25  GLD
.25  XOM

from begining of 2010 to end of 2010 

if optimized using sharpe ration, allocation that gives max return is 
0.0 GOOG
.40 AAPL
.60 GLD
0.0 XOM


Framing the problem for optimization
- provide the function to minimization f(x) => where here X is allocations where we want optimizer to give best alloactions for us
 and as we want to optimize for share raion, function is -1 * sharpe ratio (Negetive is because function with give us minimum and then negetive makes it max)
- provide initial guess for X
- call the optimizer
