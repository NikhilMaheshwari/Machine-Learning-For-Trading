Optimizer is algorithm that can do following things
- Find minimum values of a function
- build parameterized models based on data
- refine allocations to stock in portfolio

How to use an optimizer 
- Provide a function to minimize
- provide an initial guess
- call the optimizer

We can use gradient descent for finding minimizer. there are multiple methods that we can use in place of gradient descent

Convex problem 
- choose two points 
- draw a line, if line is above graph for all points then it is convex
- it has only one local minima
- No flat regions in graph

Parametized Model
- example => f(x) = mx + b
